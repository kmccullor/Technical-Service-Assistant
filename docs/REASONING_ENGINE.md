# Advanced Reasoning Engine Documentation

## Overview

The Advanced Reasoning Engine is a sophisticated system that provides multi-step analysis, knowledge synthesis, and intelligent model orchestration capabilities for the Technical Service Assistant. It goes far beyond basic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to offer comprehensive reasoning across multiple documents with conversation memory and consensus-building.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Chain-of-Thought Reasoning (`reasoning_engine/chain_of_thought.py`)

**Purpose**: Implements multi-step reasoning with query decomposition and evidence gathering.

**Key Features**:
- **Query Decomposition**: Breaks complex questions into logical components
- **Evidence Gathering**: Searches for relevant information across document corpus
- **Step-by-Step Analysis**: Performs reasoning steps with confidence tracking
- **Final Synthesis**: Combines reasoning steps into coherent answers

**Usage**:
```python
from reasoning_engine import ChainOfThoughtReasoner

reasoner = ChainOfThoughtReasoner(search_client, ollama_client, settings)
result = await reasoner.reason_through_query(cot_request)
```

### 2. Knowledge Synthesis Pipeline (`reasoning_engine/knowledge_synthesis.py`)

**Purpose**: Provides cross-document analysis with pattern recognition and contradiction detection.

**Key Features**:
- **Semantic Clustering**: Groups related information into thematic clusters
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies recurring themes across documents
- **Contradiction Detection**: Finds conflicting information and resolves conflicts
- **Multi-Perspective Analysis**: Analyzes different viewpoints and approaches
- **Comprehensive Synthesis**: Generates unified understanding from multiple sources

**Synthesis Depths**:
- **Shallow**: Basic clustering and pattern identification
- **Standard**: Full synthesis with contradiction detection
- **Deep**: Comprehensive analysis with detailed cross-referencing

### 3. Advanced Context Management (`reasoning_engine/context_management.py`)

**Purpose**: Manages conversation memory and optimizes context windows for reasoning operations.

**Key Features**:
- **Conversation Memory**: Stores and retrieves conversation history with intelligent summarization
- **Context Window Optimization**: Dynamically selects relevant context based on reasoning type
- **Relevance Scoring**: Multi-factor scoring (relevance + recency + frequency)
- **Adaptive Selection**: Different strategies for different reasoning types
- **Performance Tracking**: Monitors context efficiency and optimization metrics

**Context Selection Strategies**:
- **Diversity-focused**: Maximizes source diversity for synthesis tasks
- **Depth-focused**: Concentrates on top-scoring sources for analytical tasks
- **Balanced**: General-purpose approach balancing diversity and relevance

### 4. Enhanced Model Orchestration (`reasoning_engine/model_orchestration.py`)

**Purpose**: Provides intelligent model selection and multi-model consensus capabilities.

**Key Features**:
- **Reasoning-Aware Selection**: Chooses optimal models based on reasoning type and complexity
- **Multi-Model Consensus**: Uses multiple models with voting strategies
- **Performance Monitoring**: Tracks model performance across reasoning types
- **Dynamic Routing**: Optimizes model selection based on historical performance
- **Load Balancing**: Distributes requests across healthy model instances

**Consensus Strategies**:
- **Weighted Voting**: Combines responses based on confidence scores
- **Highest Confidence**: Selects the most confident response
- **Majority Similarity**: Finds consensus based on response similarity

## Reasoning Types and Capabilities

### Supported Reasoning Types

1. **Analytical**: Step-by-step analysis with logical decomposition
2. **Synthesis**: Cross-document knowledge synthesis with pattern recognition
3. **Comparative**: Side-by-side comparison with pros/cons analysis
4. **Factual**: Fact-based responses with source verification
5. **Creative**: Innovative thinking with multiple perspectives
6. **Chain-of-thought**: Explicit multi-step reasoning chains
7. **Auto**: Automatic type detection based on query characteristics

### Complexity Levels
