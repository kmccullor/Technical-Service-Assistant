# Daily Development Workflow

## 🌅 Start of Day Routine

Run the comprehensive morning checklist to ensure system health:

```bash
make morning
```

**What it checks:**
- ✅ Container health and service endpoints
- ✅ Database integrity (orphans, empty docs, missing embeddings)  
- ✅ System cleanup monitoring (backup files, logs, cache)
- ✅ Performance metrics (API response times, memory usage)
- ✅ Security and configuration status
- ✅ Git repository status and critical files

## 🔍 During Development

### Quick Health Checks
```bash
make health-check     # Quick service status
make check-db         # Database integrity only
make check-logs       # Recent error analysis
```

### Advanced Monitoring
```bash
make advanced-health  # Comprehensive system analysis
```

**Advanced health includes:**
- 📊 Database query performance analysis
- ⚡ Vector search response time testing
- 💻 System load trend analysis
- 🧠 Embedding quality validation
- 🛡️ Security and network status
- 🏗️ Infrastructure health metrics

### Maintenance
```bash
make cleanup          # Weekly system cleanup
```

## 🌙 End of Day Routine

Complete your workday with comprehensive backup, commit, and reporting:

```bash
make end-of-day
```

**What it does:**

### 📊 System Status Analysis
- Captures current system metrics (containers, documents, resources)
- Analyzes daily performance trends
- Checks database integrity status
- Records resource usage patterns

### 💾 Automated Backup
- Creates timestamped backup directory
- Backs up critical files and configurations:
  - `config.py`, `docker-compose.yml`
  - `scripts/`, `reranker/`, `pdf_processor/`, `frontend/`
  - `docs/`, requirements files, Makefile
  - Database schema export
- Reports backup size and success status

### 🔄 Git Operations
- **Auto-commits all changes** with descriptive message
- Includes system status in commit message
- Analyzes today's development activity
- Records commit statistics and file changes

### 📋 Daily Report Generation
Creates comprehensive markdown report in `logs/daily_report_YYYYMMDD.md`:

**Report Includes:**
- 🎯 **System Health Overview** - Container status, database metrics, resource usage
- 📝 **Development Activity** - Git changes, commits, modified files
- ⚡ **Performance Metrics** - API response times, error rates, processing stats
- 💾 **Backup Summary** - Location, size, success status
- 🗄️ **Database Integrity** - Orphan chunks, empty docs, missing embeddings
- 🎯 **Daily Accomplishments** - Features added, bugs fixed, documentation updates
- ⚠️ **Issues & Recommendations** - Problems found and suggested fixes
- 🎉 **Positive Highlights** - System performance achievements
- 📋 **Tomorrow's Checklist** - Action items for next day

## 📈 Report Features

### Automated Analysis
- **Performance Trending** - API response times, failure rates
- **Resource Monitoring** - Memory, disk, Docker usage
- **Development Metrics** - Commit frequency, file change patterns
- **Quality Indicators** - Database integrity, system health scores

### Issue Detection
- High embedding failure rates (>50/day)
- Excessive disk usage (>85%)
- Many uncommitted changes (>20 files)
- Error log accumulation (>5 files with errors)

### Positive Recognition
- Excellent API performance (<0.5s response times)
- Perfect database integrity (no orphans/missing data)
- Full system health (all containers running)

## 🔄 Complete Daily Workflow

# Morning startup
make morning                 # Comprehensive health check

# During development
make health-check           # Quick status checks
make advanced-health        # Deep analysis (weekly)
make cleanup               # System maintenance (weekly)

# End of day
make end-of-day            # Backup, commit, report
```
