## ðŸ’¡ My Recommendation

**Start with Phase 1 embedding fine-tuning** (2 weeks):

1. **Low Risk:** Build on proven foundation
2. **High Impact:** Expected +5% accuracy improvement 
3. **Learning Value:** Establishes fine-tuning capabilities
4. **Decision Point:** Evaluate results before committing to full 6-week plan

**Commands to begin:**
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install sentence-transformers datasets

# Start Phase 1 fine-tuning
python embedding_fine_tuner.py

# Monitor progress
python test_phase1_improvements.py
```
