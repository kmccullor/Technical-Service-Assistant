# Accuracy Improvement Implementation Summary

## üéØ Phase 1 Implementation Completed

### Overview
Successfully implemented all three major accuracy improvements targeting the transition from 72.7% baseline to 85%+ overall accuracy:

1. **Security Document Classification Fix** ‚úÖ
2. **Enhanced Metadata Extraction** ‚úÖ  
3. **Query Expansion System** ‚úÖ

## üîí Security Document Classification Fix

**Target**: 42.9% ‚Üí 90%+ accuracy for security documents

**Implementation**: 
- Added `SECURITY_DOCUMENT_PATTERNS` dictionary with filename and content patterns
- Implemented `apply_security_classification_overrides()` function in `pdf_utils_enhanced.py`
- Integrated override logic into both AI and fallback classification functions

**Key Features**:
- 13 filename patterns (e.g., `.*security.*guide.*`, `.*hsm.*installation.*`)
- 16 content patterns (e.g., `hardware\s+security\s+module`, `cryptographic\s+keys?`)
- High confidence scores (0.90-0.95) for pattern matches
- Product extraction from both filename and content

**Test Results**: 
- ‚úÖ Hardware Security Module Installation Guide ‚Üí correctly classified as `security_guide`
- ‚úÖ Security Configuration Manual ‚Üí correctly classified as `security_guide`
- ‚úÖ Certificate Management Guide ‚Üí correctly classified as `security_guide`
- ‚úÖ Regular user guides ‚Üí no false positives

## üìã Enhanced Metadata Extraction

**Target**: 22.6% ‚Üí 85%+ accuracy for title extraction

**Implementation**:
- Enhanced `extract_pdf_structure_metadata()` function with improved title detection
- Added PDF structure analysis with font size, position, and content filtering
- Implemented sophisticated title candidate validation

**Key Improvements**:
- Better PDF metadata validation (filters out "Untitled", numbers-only, etc.)
- First-page structure analysis using font size and position
- Top-portion text block analysis (top 200 points)
- Multi-criteria title candidate filtering:
  - Font size ‚â• 12 points
  - Length 10-150 characters
  - Excludes headers/footers patterns
  - Position-based priority (top-first)

**Features Added**:
- Font information extraction
- Y-position based sorting
- Pattern exclusion for non-titles
- Enhanced metadata fields (creation date, modification date)

## üîç Query Expansion System

**Target**: 55% ‚Üí 90%+ accuracy for FlexNet/ESM queries

**Implementation**:
- Added `expand_query_with_synonyms()` function in `reranker/app.py`
- Integrated expansion into search_documents endpoint for both vector and text search
- Created comprehensive synonym dictionaries

**Product Synonyms**:
- **FlexNet**: flexnet, flex net, flexlm, flex lm, license manager, licensing
- **ESM**: esm, enterprise security manager, security manager, enterprise security  
- **RNI**: rni, radiant networking inc, radiant, networking
- **MultiSpeak**: multispeak, multi speak, multi-speak, utility communication
- **PPA**: ppa, power plant automation, plant automation

**Domain Expansions**:
- **install**: installation, setup, deployment, configure, configuration
- **license**: licensing, activation, key, token
- **security**: authentication, authorization, encryption, certificate
- **troubleshoot**: debug, error, issue, problem, fix
- **upgrade**: update, migration, version
- **guide**: manual, documentation, instructions, tutorial

**Test Results**:
- ‚úÖ "FlexNet installation guide" ‚Üí +3 synonym terms
- ‚úÖ "ESM security configuration" ‚Üí +5 synonym terms  
- ‚úÖ "flex lm troubleshooting" ‚Üí +3 synonym terms
- ‚úÖ "enterprise security manager installation" ‚Üí +2 synonym terms

## üß™ Validation Results

### Security Classification Test
- **5/5 test cases passed** with correct pattern matching
- Hardware Security Module guides correctly identified
- No false positives on regular installation guides
- Confidence scores appropriately assigned (0.90-0.95)

### Query Expansion Test  
- **6/6 test cases passed** with proper synonym addition
- FlexNet/ESM variations correctly expanded
- Domain terms appropriately supplemented
- No expansion for generic queries (correct behavior)

## üéØ Expected Accuracy Improvements

Based on the specific issues identified in the analysis:

1. **Security Documents**: 42.9% ‚Üí **90%+** (pattern-based override with high confidence)
2. **Metadata Extraction**: 22.6% ‚Üí **85%+** (multi-layer title detection with structure analysis)  
3. **FlexNet/ESM Queries**: 55% ‚Üí **90%+** (comprehensive synonym expansion)

**Overall Projected Accuracy**: 72.7% ‚Üí **85%+**

## üöÄ Implementation Files Modified

1. **`pdf_processor/pdf_utils_enhanced.py`**:
   - Added `SECURITY_DOCUMENT_PATTERNS`
   - Added `apply_security_classification_overrides()`
   - Enhanced `extract_pdf_structure_metadata()`
   - Integrated security overrides into classification functions

2. **`reranker/app.py`**:
   - Added `PRODUCT_SYNONYMS` and `DOMAIN_EXPANSIONS`
   - Added `expand_query_with_synonyms()`
   - Integrated query expansion into `search_documents()`

3. **Test Files Created**:
