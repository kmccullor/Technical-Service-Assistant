## 📊 Detailed Improvement Analysis

### 🔍 **Primary Opportunity: Query Expansion Enhancement**

**Current Performance**: 83.3% (5/6 test cases passing)  
**Root Cause**: Single failing test case - `"license activation problems"`  
**Issue**: Problem detection not triggering support terms

#### **The Failing Case**:
```
Query: "license activation problems"
Expected: ['licensing', 'troubleshoot', 'debug'] 
Current:  ['licensing'] (1/3 found = 33.3%)
Enhanced: ['licensing', 'troubleshoot', 'debug'] (3/3 found = 100%)
```

#### **Fix Implementation**:
```python
# Add enhanced problem detection patterns
PROBLEM_TRIGGERS = {
    'problems': ['troubleshoot', 'debug', 'error', 'issue', 'fix'],
    'issues': ['troubleshoot', 'debug', 'error', 'problem', 'fix'],
    'errors': ['troubleshoot', 'debug', 'issue', 'problem', 'fix'],
    'failures': ['troubleshoot', 'debug', 'error', 'issue', 'fix']
}
```

#### **Impact Calculation**:
- Query Expansion: 83.3% → **100.0%** (+16.7 percentage points)
- Component Weight: 35% of overall accuracy
- Overall Impact: 89.9% → **95.7%** (+5.8 percentage points)
