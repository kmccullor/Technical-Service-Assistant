5. **Database Questions**: ‚ö†Ô∏è MIXED - Knowledge retrieval working but slow

## üîç Detailed Analysis

### Failure Categories
- **Timeout Errors**: 11 tests (84.6% of failures) - Primary concern
- **API Errors**: 1 test (7.7% of failures) - Minor issue
- **Other Errors**: 1 test (7.7% of failures) - Edge case

### Performance Distribution
- **Tests >5 seconds**: 70/71 (98.6%) - Almost all tests slow
- **Tests >10 seconds**: 64/71 (90.1%) - Majority exceeding acceptable time
- **Tests >20 seconds**: 27/71 (38.0%) - Significant portion very slow
- **95th Percentile**: 31.03 seconds - Extreme outliers

### Document Retrieval Effectiveness
- **Source Retrieval Rate**: 76% - Good document matching
- **Average Sources per Test**: Varies by query complexity
- **Max Sources Found**: Multiple relevant documents retrieved
- **Confidence Distribution**: Consistently low but functional

## üõ†Ô∏è Critical Recommendations

### 1. Performance Optimization (CRITICAL)
**Problem**: 19+ second average response time is unacceptable for production use.

**Immediate Actions**:
- **Ollama Configuration**: Optimize model inference settings for faster response
- **Response Caching**: Implement Redis/memory caching for frequently asked questions
- **Database Optimization**: Add proper indexing and query optimization for vector searches
- **Request Queuing**: Implement async processing with request queue management

**Expected Impact**: Reduce average response time to <5 seconds

### 2. System Stability (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Problem**: 11 timeout errors indicate system reliability issues.

**Immediate Actions**:
- **Timeout Configuration**: Implement progressive timeout strategies (30s ‚Üí 60s ‚Üí fail)
- **Circuit Breakers**: Add circuit breaker pattern for Ollama service calls
- **Health Monitoring**: Implement real-time health checks for all services
- **Retry Logic**: Add exponential backoff retry for transient failures

**Expected Impact**: Reduce failure rate to <5%

### 3. Confidence Score Tuning (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Problem**: Average confidence of 0.012 suggests threshold misconfiguration.

**Immediate Actions**:
- **Threshold Analysis**: Test confidence thresholds from 0.005 to 0.05
- **Embedding Model Evaluation**: Compare nomic-embed-text with alternatives
- **Hybrid Search Tuning**: Optimize vector + lexical search fusion weights
- **Document Preprocessing**: Review chunking strategy for better semantic alignment

**Expected Impact**: Improve confidence scores while maintaining accuracy

### 4. Load Balancing & Scaling (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Problem**: System cannot handle concurrent requests effectively.

**Immediate Actions**:
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Add more Ollama instances with proper load distribution
- **Connection Pooling**: Implement database connection pooling
- **Resource Monitoring**: Add CPU/memory monitoring and auto-scaling
- **Request Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent overload

**Expected Impact**: Support higher concurrent user load
